## Setting up Gitpod

### What is Gitpod?

We are using *Gitpod* to provide hands-on experience with installing and using the pathogen surveillance pipeline we developed. [**Gitpod**](https://gitpod.io/) allows you to launch and enter Virtual Machines from your browser and gives you 50 free hours per calendar month, enough for this session.

### How do I sign up for Gitpod?

You MUST do the following steps before the workshop starts! It will take a few minutes to set up a **GitHub** account and a **Gitpod** account if you don't already have them:

### 1. **Step 00**  
   Click on [this link](https://gitpod.io/new#https://github.com/grunwaldlab/aps_workshop) in any desktop web browser (**Note: Safari sometimes has problems on a Mac, so use Chrome or Mozilla instead)**  
   ![Step 00](content/Untitled%206.png)

### 2. **Step 01**  
   It will ask you to sign up with a GitHub account. If you don't have one, please create an account at [GitHub](https://github.com).  
   ![Step 01](content/Untitled%207.png)

### 3. **Step 02**  
   Once you are signed in to GitHub, click on the Gitpod link above again. It will try to launch our Gitpod workspace using your GitHub login. You will need to give Gitpod permission to access (only) the email address on your GitHub account. Follow the Gitpod prompts to ensure you are a real human and won't misuse their resources. **Note: if it asks you to connect your LinkedIn, you can skip that - you will still get 50 hours :-)**

### 4. **Step 03**  
   Gitpod will ask you to select which code editor and which machine size to start. The defaults are fine. So just click **Continue**  
   ![Step 03](content/Untitled%208.png)

### 5. **Step 04**  
   Once the Gitpod workspace starts (typically in less than a minute), you will see the following in your desktop web browser: a file browser on your left, a text editor top right, and a Linux terminal bottom right.  
   ![Step 04](content/Untitled.jpeg)

> *If you are doing this before the workshop, please go to [gitpod.io/workspaces](https://gitpod.io/workspaces) to delete any running workspaces (in green) so that you don't use up your 50 hours per month* 🙂

# Exploring PathogenSurveillance Outputs

This document will guide you through the key output directories generated by the `PathogenSurveillance` pipeline. You will learn where to find the outputs and understand their significance.

## `sendsketch`

The `sendsketch` process in the PathogenSurveillance pipeline utilizes the BBMap tool to generate sketch data for the input sequences. This step is crucial for identifying and comparing genomic sequences against a reference database.

### Key output directory: `output/bbmap_sendsketch/`

This directory contains symbolic links to the actual output files generated by the `sendsketch` process. The outputs are stored in the working directory under a unique identifier.

```sh
# Let's list the output for sendsketch:
ll output/bbmap_sendsketch/

# Take a look at output for the sample we included here:
head output/bbmap_sendsketch/*.txt
```

  > ## 🧐 What does all this mean? and Why?   
  > 
  >  ### Sketches
  >  
  >  Sketching is a technique used in bioinformatics to create a compact representation of a sequence. This method reduces the memory and computational requirements for sequence comparison. Sketches are generated using a subset of k-mers (short subsequences of length k) from the original sequence.
  >  
  >  ### K-mers
  >  
  >  - **Definition**: K-mers are contiguous sequences of k nucleotides. For example, in the sequence `AGCT`, the 2-mers (k=2) are `AG`, `GC`, and `CT`.
  >  - **Usage**: K-mers are used to break down large sequences into smaller, manageable pieces. They are essential for tasks such as sequence alignment, error correction, and genome assembly.
  >  - **Sketch generation**: A sketch is generated by selecting a representative subset of k-mers from the sequence. This subset captures the essential characteristics of the sequence, allowing for efficient and accurate comparisons.
  >  
  >  ### Importance in Pathogen Surveillance
  >  
  >  - **Efficient Comparison**: Sketches enable the rapid comparison of genomic sequences against large reference databases, facilitating the identification of pathogens.
  >  - **Data Reduction**: By reducing the size of the data to be compared, sketches make it feasible to analyze large datasets within a reasonable time frame and with limited computational resources.
